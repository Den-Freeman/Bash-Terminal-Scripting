$find /home/analyst/projects
#Searches for everything starting at the /projects directory

$find /home/analyst/projects -name "*log*"
$find /home/analyst/projects -iname "*log*"
#The difference between these two options is that -name is case-sensitive, and -iname is not. 
#One key criteria analysts might use with find is to find file or directory names that contain a specific string.

#Note: An asterisk (*) is used as a wildcard to represent zero or more unknown characters.

$find /home/analyst/projects -mtime -3
returns all files and directories in the projects directory that have been modified within the past three days.

$chmod o-w project_k.txt
#Change the permissions of the file identified in the previous step so that the owner type of other doesnâ€™t have write permissions.

#Use the chown command to make researcher9 the owner of /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
